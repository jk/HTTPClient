# HTTPClient

Fork of the HTTPClient by Todd Ditchendorf. Todd sells a further developed version of his former open sourced application on the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/http-client/id418138339?mt=12). The feature set is a bit different from this version here on github.

It's a Mac OS X developer tool for debugging HTTP services by graphically creating and inspecting complex HTTP messages. In my opinon you will use mostly during developing web services. At least that's what I'm using it for.

Perhaps somebody wants tu supply us with an OAuth2 implementation?

## Methology

As of now, I use the [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching approach during development. Feature branches will not be pushed to this repository. New feature will be available, when they're merged with the developer branch. The master branch should be stable.

## Roadmap

* OAuth2 implementation
* Better syntax highlighting
* T.B.D.
